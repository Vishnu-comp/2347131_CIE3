1e28uxc,ld09tob,"With the advent of AI - tech product companies and full stack software companies may try to optimise on costs by automating some dev functions. 

But - there are still a lot of legacy big businesses that would need help with tech, IT legacy turnaround (consultants call it digital transformation) etc. and they would be forced to become tech first rather than tech enabled companies. This is what will drive hiring for many devs - especially for the ones that are good but not as good as FAANG guys. 

I think the big tech evolution also will be interesting. Everyone thought finance will be taken over by web3 innovation - but nothing happened there. Investment bankers and hedge fund bros are still pulling in sweat monies. (Insert that blue eyes, 6’5”, guy in finance meme - still hot in dating market too 😄😂) 

So the AI thing may well be a red herring and at best it just becomes an enabler but not an outright disruptor. If even skilled white collar work force becomes unemployed - that’s too much to handle for all world governments. We’ll be seeing a repeat of French Revolution, Arab spring etc. 

TL,DR: Situation will taper off, jobs growth will come from tech enabled companies that will try to become tech first. Big tech will also stabilise and AI thing can very well may turn out be a red-herring.",2,0.9884,What will the job market be like in two years? Especially in India

DE and ML Platform engineer roles should see steady growth as to sustain the AI boom, you need efficient data and ML pipelines. But the skill requirement will increase as knowing just one/two ETL tools/frameworks will not cut it.

Hiring in the IT sector should continue but the salaries will plateau (max 4x/5x of YOE) as the supply of candidates is more than the demand.

Product scene I am not so sure as in my experience the hiring situation is much worse there (even compared to 2022/23).

If that happens, all data teams of US companies will remain in the US. 

Just to give you an example of how strict these laws are, I work in the healthcare AI space in the US.

It's also not Apple, who likely aren't trying to interfere in their partner's business. It's the site itself.....though they relax it when they **need** more personnel. 

This article can hopefully shed light on the situation to force the site to quit its discriminatory practices. 

> In a statement, Foxconn said it “vigorously refutes allegations of employment discrimination based on marital status, gender, religion or any other form.”

Shut up.

Free Trade is and has always been a bs economic theory that doesn't match any of the numbers that were projected. We've had deficits and the lowering of the middleclass ever since. 


I say it doesn't make sense to have a blanket trade policy. We need individual ones tailored to the specifics. We can compete with nations of similar standards of living, but Americans can't compete with workers who can live on a fraction of the pay. 


No amount of education will help if someone in a much cheaper country can do the same work for significantly less. So I know it's a dirty word because both parties spent decades demonizing it and were accomplices in Free Trade, but our founder believed highly in tariffs. To make imports so expensive that the cheaper option would be to produce in America. 


So you get more jobs, higher wages because Americans will actually compete against other Americans again, and more benefits. Now bringing manufacturing back won't happen overnight, so I think since government enacted policies to lose us these jobs, they should be tasked with the rebuilding and reinvesting of American made goods.


 That we need to ween ourselves off of this policy that has caused us to have trade deficits every year since, when we used to have trade surpluses. 


If you want access to the high purchasing power and money of the American market it shouldn't be free. Either you benefit us by having jobs, or for every good you import and try to cut costs on that the fee for doing so goes directly into our treasury. The way tariffs were designed for since our founding until about 4 decades ago.

1ci8s6g,l2dpk95,"I have been saying it repeatedly and I will say it again. The Google of today is not the fabled Google of my childhood. I wanted to join there for long as a child but didn't think it was possible then. However, I improved my skills drastically and did believe that I was good enough to get in but was shocked at the interview culture there. 

I have interviewed with them 3 times and been unimpressed each time. The quality of people has dropped, the quality of products has dropped. Everything has dropped. 

* **Egoistic Interviewers** - The interviewers usually pick out hard questions which they **do not know how to solve themselves**. This is evidenced by the fact that they cannot ask simple questions like what the constraints are. (Instead they ask you to give the constraints and try to pass of their incompetence as a way of gauging how you deal with ambiguity).  They usually cannot understand or appreciate the thought process to solve that problem. And if you do solve that problem, they will make sure the feedback is filled with all kinds of meaningless negativity. 
* **Vindictive Feedback** - There was an instance where I was asked a problem. I was able to come up with the optimum algorithm very quickly. The interviewer then proposed an unnecessary difficulty creep and asked me to write code that would solve for an array of generics rather than an array of integers. I was then writing the code in Google Doc while he was copy pasting what I was writing and compiling it. I was expecting a 'Strong Hire' in this round. However, when the recruiter read the feedback, it was 'Smart candidate who solved the algorithm quickly.' He then proceeded to write 3 paragraphs with lengthy explanations of every compile error I got. You would have forgotten I solved the problem by the time I finished. 
* **Googliness** - I was excited to answer questions like name your favourite Google products or what do you like about Google or what excites you about working in technology or what inspires you. Instead, I got energy draining questions like 'Tell me about a time you failed' or 'How would you plan a team outing'. The interviewers also had no energy and I felt depressed after it. 
* **Broken hiring process** - It's really weird that the people in the hiring committee are not the ones who have taken your interview. It's also strange to find a team or role only after your interviews. The candidate has no idea which team he would work in while he is interviewing in. The so-called team matching itself takes months. However, most people in Google are very proud of their broken hiring process. 
* **Decline in Product Quality** - I was not a fan of most of their products 2-3 years ago other than Search, Pay and Maps. Google Maps regularly leads drivers to dead ends or into roads where cyclists would fear to enter. Pay hangs and Search is no longer the de facto. People are moving away from Search to other Search Engines with privacy differentiators like DuckDuckGo or AI like Bing and Perplexity. People prefer using Reddit while searching for product reviews. I don't think it's leading the AI race - it was witnessed in multiple failed demos, which we later found were faked. 

  
It's not at all surprising to me that they are having to do layoffs. I would not want to join the company now. I can only imagine how political it is to get a promotion considering how much politics happens in just being hired.",2,-0.9833,Google lays off hundreds of core employees and moves jobs to India and Mexico

1ci8s6g,l29ep3t,"> Microsoft isn't moving jobs to India

That's because they started that transition 2 decades ago. Cisco, IBM and oracle aren't moving jobs to India either. But that's because the jobs they'd move are already there by now

Regardless, how can you look at the last couple of years and think layoffs have anything to do with how well the company was doing? If there's profits to be made by firing you, you're gone",33,0.5267,Google lays off hundreds of core employees and moves jobs to India and Mexico
